//! Event definitions and emission.
//!
//! Stream discovery is an off-chain concern — the contract keeps no per-user
//! index (see the `lib.rs` module docs). That makes these events the *only* way
//! an indexer learns that a stream exists or that its state moved, so they are
//! load-bearing infrastructure rather than optional telemetry.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! * Every state change emits exactly one event.
//! * Events are declared with `#[contractevent]`, so their schemas land in the
//!   contract's interface spec. Tooling and the TypeScript SDK generate typed
//!   decoders from that spec instead of hand-rolling topic parsers.
//! * The static topic is the struct name in snake_case. `stream_id` is always a
//!   topic, as are the addresses an indexer routes on, so a consumer can filter
//!   server-side by event kind, by stream, or by party.
//! * Each payload carries enough state to reconstruct the stream without
//!   replaying from genesis.
//!
//! Field order and topic placement are ABI. Adding a field is a compatible
//! change; reordering or re-topicking one is not.
//!
//! Note that item-level doc comments on a `#[contractevent]` struct are copied
//! into the contract spec and therefore into the deployed wasm. Statements of
//! the ABI belong there; the reasoning behind them belongs here, where it costs
//! the contract nothing.
//!
//! # `Cancelled.vested`: total vested, not the withdrawable remainder
//!
//! Issue #1584. `cancelled` publishes `refunded`, `vested` and `withdrawn`,
//! which makes it a public accounting statement, and `vested` had two defensible
//! readings: everything the recipient has earned over the life of the stream, or
//! only the part of it they can still pull. The two differ exactly when the
//! recipient withdrew before the cancel.
//!
//! The ruling is **total vested**, cumulative and inclusive of `withdrawn`,
//! because that is the reading that keeps the event self-checking:
//!
//! * Conservation holds unconditionally: `refunded + vested` equals the
//!   pre-cancel `deposited` for every stream. Under the withdrawable reading
//!   that identity fails for any partially withdrawn stream, and a reconciler
//!   could no longer tell a broken contract from an ordinary one.
//! * No information is lost. The event carries `withdrawn`, so the remainder is
//!   `vested - withdrawn`. The reverse does not hold — from the remainder
//!   alone, total vested is unrecoverable.
//! * It matches storage one-for-one: cancellation rewrites `deposited` to the
//!   vested amount, so an indexer mirroring `deposited` assigns the field
//!   directly. [`cancelled`] reads it straight off the settled stream for that
//!   reason, which is what makes divergence between event and storage
//!   unrepresentable rather than merely untested.
//!
//! The cancel itself moves nothing to the recipient: they still pull
//! `vested - withdrawn` through the normal withdraw path, which is why that
//! amount stays pooled in the contract. Every cancellation state is asserted
//! against storage and token balances in `test::cancel_events`.
