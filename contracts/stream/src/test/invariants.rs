//! Stage 3 — the pool invariant under randomized operation sequences.
//!
//! Individual tests assert the pool invariant after the operations they perform,
//! but they only cover sequences somebody thought to write down. This file
//! drives long random sequences through the real contract and re-checks every
//! invariant after **every single operation**, which is where unforeseen
//! interactions between pause, cancel, top-up and transfer would surface.
//!
//! Randomness comes from a small deterministic PRNG rather than `rand`, so a
//! failure is reproducible from its seed alone: the failure message prints the
//! seed and the step, and re-running that seed replays the exact sequence.
