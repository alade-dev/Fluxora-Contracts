//! Storage access and TTL management.
//!
//! # Why TTL is the hard part
//!
//! Soroban persistent entries have a time-to-live measured in ledgers. When it
//! runs out the entry is archived and becomes unreadable until explicitly
//! restored. A stream running twelve months will outlive its default TTL.
//!
//! If a stream entry archives the tokens are *not* lost — they sit in the
//! contract's pooled balance — but the accounting entry saying who they belong to
//! is inaccessible until someone pays to restore it. For a payroll or grant
//! primitive that is unacceptable, so the contract engineers around it three
//! ways:
//!
//! 1. **Extend on every touch.** Every function that reads or writes a stream
//!    bumps that entry's TTL. An actively-used stream never expires.
//! 2. **Extend generously at creation**, targeting the stream's remaining
//!    lifetime plus a buffer, clamped to the network maximum.
//! 3. **Permissionless top-ups** via `extend_stream_ttl`, so a keeper —or the
//!    recipient, or any passer-by — can keep a claim readable without the
//!    sender's cooperation.
